👋 Hi, I’m @adgodoyo
👀 I’m interested in applying Machine Learning and Big Data to solve real-world problems, particularly in the realms of public policy and social impact projects. As an educator, I am passionate about developing the next generation of AI talent, so my public repositories are in general for educational purposes.
🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in Large Language Models (LLM) and embedding models.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI initiatives that drive significant social or economic benefits, and projects that can influence policymaking through data-driven insights.
📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adgodoyo/)
⚡ Fun fact: While I teach courses in AI and Big Data at the university level, I also actively explore how AI can improve educational methods and student engagement. I love languages and music.
