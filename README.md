👋 Hi, I’m @adgodoyo
👀 I’m interested in applying Machine Learning and Big Data to solve real-world problems, particularly in the realms of public policy and social impact projects. As an educator, I am passionate about developing the next generation of AI talent, so my public repositories are in general for educational purposes.

🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in Large Language Models (LLM) and embedding models.
👀 I’m looking to collaborate on AI initiatives that drive significant social or economic benefits, and projects that can influence policymaking through data-driven insights.
